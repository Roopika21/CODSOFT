# CODSOFT - INTERNSHIP
Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

This project, completed during my CodSoft internship, focuses on predicting customer churn, helping businesses identify and retain at-risk customers.

Project Overview

Using a dataset of customer demographics, account info, services used, and billing methods, we developed a machine learning model to predict churn.

Workflow

1. Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, encoded categorical data, and scaled features.
2. EDA: Explored patterns and correlations in churn behavior.
3. Modeling: Trained and evaluated models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost) using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
4. Insights: Identified important factors such as contract type, monthly charges, and tenure influencing churn.

Results

This model is achieved with key insights into factors affecting churn, providing actionable data for customer retention strategies.


Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

This project, developed during my CodSoft internship, aims to identify fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning.

Project Overview

Using an anonymized dataset of transaction records, we applied data preprocessing and several machine learning models to detect fraud accurately.

Workflow

1. Data Preprocessing: Addressed data imbalance with SMOTE and scaled features.
2. EDA: Explored transaction patterns and the distribution of fraudulent vs. legitimate transactions.
3. Modeling: Trained models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, XGBoost) and evaluated them using metrics like precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.
4. Insights: Identified key features that indicate potential fraud.

Results

The selected model achieved high accuracy in detecting fraud, showcasing the importance of machine learning in enhancing financial security.


Spam SMS Detection using Machine Learning

This project, completed during my CodSoft internship, aims to identify spam messages in SMS communications using machine learning.

Project Overview

Using a labeled dataset of SMS messages, we built a model to classify texts as spam or legitimate (ham).

Workflow

1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and tokenized text data; applied TF-IDF for vectorization.
2. EDA: Analyzed word frequency patterns to understand common spam indicators.
3. Modeling: Trained models like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and SVM, evaluating with accuracy, precision, and recall.


Results

The final model achieved high accuracy in identifying spam, showcasing the utility of machine learning in enhancing message filtering.
